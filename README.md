### Customer Responses to FMCG Retail Marketing Campaign
The problem is a binary classification task within the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) retail sector. The aim is to predict customer response to a marketing campaign based on demographic and shopping behavior features. Given a dataset containing information about customers' demographics and shopping behavior, the goal is to train a model that can accurately predict whether a customer will respond positively or negatively to a marketing campaign. The target response variable is binary, indicating whether a customer responded positively (1) or negatively (0) to the marketing campaign. The problem is considered as imbalanced due to the low ratio of positive responses (around 0.16%) in the dataset, thus requires special handling to tackle the imbalance problem while training and evaluating the model.
