The retail industry is a highly competitive and dynamic field, where companies must constantly strive to improve customer experience in order to retain existing customers and attract new ones. One of the key strategies employed by retailers is the use of marketing campaigns, which are designed to increase sales, promote brand awareness, and encourage customer loyalty.

With the advent of data science and machine learning techniques, retailers now have the ability to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior and preferences, enabling a more personalized approach to campaign strategy. This study aims to leverage this capability by predicting the effectiveness of marketing campaigns utilizing demographic and historical spending data of customers within a specified campaign period.

The goal is to classify customers into two categories: those who are likely to respond positively to the campaign, and those who are likely to respond negatively. The target response variable is binary, indicating whether a customer responded positively (1) or negatively (0) to the marketing campaign. However, the dataset presents an imbalanced target response variable with a low ratio of positive responses (approximately 0.16%), this requires special handling to address this issue during model training and evaluation. This study aims to develop a model that can accurately predict customer response to marketing campaigns and tackle the imbalanced data problem, in order to improve the campaign's effectiveness and increase revenue for the retail industry.
